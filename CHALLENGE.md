# Snake Game

Recreate the game SNAKE in python

completion will prove the following graded criteria, if completed the intended way. Please try to solve the challenge by meeting these criteria

- pipenv set up and used
- type annotations in Python 3.10+
- for loops comprehension
- datatypes comprehension
- classes
    - you are expected to implement Player and TailSegment
- lists
    - if your solution doesn't use the snake tail as a list, then congrats i have no idea how you'd do that, but please demonstrate in some other place the use of a list
- conditionals
- debugging systems

logic wise, please have the snake wrap around the screen when it hits any edge


When completed, DM luke a link to your code uploaded onto github


The exact implementation of drawing mechanisms isn't important, so most of that has been taken care of you with enough hints written into the code to complete it. Try as hard as you can before the first lesson to complete the challenge.
